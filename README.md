# Diffusers
A Unity package to run pretrained diffusion models with Unity Sentis

[OpenUPM] · [Documentation (coming soon)] · [Feedback/Questions]

## About

A large part of this project is a port of Hugging Face’s [diffusers] library.
It is still early, so as of today we only support:
- a simple StableDifusionPipeline compatible with Stable Diffusion 1.5
- the default PNDMScheduler
