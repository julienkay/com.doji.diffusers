# Diffusers
A Unity package to run pretrained diffusion models with Unity Sentis

[OpenUPM] Â· [Documentation (coming soon)] Â· [Feedback/Questions]

## About

This is essentially a port of Hugging Faceâ€™s [diffusers] library.

As of today only a limited number of pipelines and schedulers are supported (see below).

### Installation

<details>
  <summary> via OpenUPM </summary>
  
 1. In `Edit -> Project Settings -> Package Manager`, add a new scoped registry:

        Name: Doji
        URL: https://package.openupm.com
        Scope(s): com.doji
 
  4. In the Package Manager install `com.doji.diffusers` either by name or select it in the list under `Package Manager -> My Registries`
  5. For the time being,  you also have to use a custom fork of Sentis: In the package Manager -> `Package Manager -> Install package from git URL-> https://github.com/julienkay/com.unity.sentis.git`
